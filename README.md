# game-net-basics

Code for a basic client-server network game. Mainly for educational purposes. The code is in C# and
uses Monogame (https://www.monogame.net/).

## TODO

*   Change the server to handle multiple clients.
*   Have each client's character be a different color, and allow colors to mix when characters run
    into each other.
*   Allow clients to connect to the server from other computers.
*   Add sound effects.
